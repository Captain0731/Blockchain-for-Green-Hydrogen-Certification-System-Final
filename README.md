# Blockchain-for-Green-Hydrogen-Certification-System-Final




# Green Hydrogen Platform

## Overview

A blockchain-based certification and carbon credit trading platform for green hydrogen production. The system enables users to issue digital certificates for hydrogen production, manage carbon credits, and trade them in a real-time marketplace. Built with Python Flask and featuring a simulated blockchain for transaction immutability, the platform combines environmental sustainability tracking with decentralized verification mechanisms.
